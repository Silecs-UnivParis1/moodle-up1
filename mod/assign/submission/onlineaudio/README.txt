Online Audio Recording assignment submission module for Moodle 2.3

INTRODUCTION:
The Online Audio Recording assignment submission plugin allows teachers to set up assignments which accept online audio recordings.  Students can then simply record a snippet of audio (in MP3 format) instead of uploading (or choosing) a file, as (part of) their assignment submission.  No streaming server is required to use this plugin; recording is done entirely on the user's computer, with the file uploaded via HTTP.
