This files describes API changes for course formats

Overview of this plugin type at http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Course_formats

=== 2.4 ===

Course format API has been changed significantly. Instead of implementing callbacks course formats
may overwrite the class format_base. See format_legacy class for a template for upgrading course
format.

* Function settings_navigation::add_course_editing_links() is completely removed, course format
  functions callback_XXXX_request_key() are no longer used (where XXXX is the course format name)
* functions get_generic_section_name(), get_all_sections(), add_mod_to_section(), get_all_mods()
  are deprecated. See their phpdocs in lib/deprecatedlib.php on how to replace them
* Course formats may now have their settings.php file as the most of other plugin types
* Function format_section_renderer_base::is_section_current() is deprecated, overwrite/use
  function is_section_current in format class

=== 2.3 ===

* The new $course->coursedisplay option was introduced, users can now choose to display
  a section at a time if the course formats support it:
 - COURSE_DISPLAY_SINGLEPAGE indicates the teacher has chosen to display all sections on one page
 - COURSE_DISPLAY_MULTIPAGE indicates the teacher has chose to have seperate pages with each section.

* The parameter for 'currently active section' was standardised in core:
  - The course format is passed the currently live section through the $displaysection varaible to format.php
  - A 'section' paramter is the standardised way to pass around the current section in a course
  - Navigation no longer looks for custom parameters defined in callback_format_request_key
